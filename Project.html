    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Urbanization and the Spread of Infectious Disease in 19th Century Canada</h1>
    <center><img src="M992X.5.82.jpg" style="width:804px;height:728px;"></center>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Purpose and Scope of this Project</h2>
    <p>As a student of history at Carleton University, my area of interest is in Canadian urban and social history. During my studies 
    I have bacome particularly interested in 19th century Canada and the effects of industrialization and urbanization. While I have 
    had great success in my studies thus far, these successes have been within the traditional methods of the discipline; research and 
    essay writing. As such, this is my very first attempt at a digital history project, and is intended only to be an exploration of the ways in which 
    the methods and tools used by digital historians could be applied to the subject matter of a more traditional history project. In 
    other words, my purpose is to explore the ways in which these methods could supplement, or add an extra layer to, traditional 
    projects I have done in the past dealing with this subject matter. The benefit here is that the data collected and the visualizations created 
    in this project would be extremely time consuming, if not impossible, in the traditional method; and, not to mention, terribly 
    impractical.</p>
    <p>Being that this is my first attempt at creating such a project, I feel that it is very important to state from the outset that 
    the scope of this project is very limited and, as stated above, experimental. The datasets I am working with are very limited in that 
    they have been collected from only one source, the <a href="http://search.canadiana.ca/" target="_blank">Canadiana Discovery Portal.</a></p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Throughout the 19th century, the growth of industry in Canadian cities saw an increase in the urbanization of the 
    population. During this period the percentage of the population moving to reside within major Canadian cities such 
    as Montreal and Toronto significantly outpaced the development of infrastructure (see: Bettina Bradbury, "Pigs, Cows and Boarders: 
    Non-Wage Forms of Survival among Montreal Families, 1861-91," <i> Labour/Le Travail,</i> 14, 1998). This lack of infrastructure, 
    particularly 
    sanitary infrastructure, was the leading cause of the spread of infectious disease and resulted in increased mortality rates, 
    particularly among the young and old, and most prominently in poorer, working-class communities (see: Patricia Thronton and Sherry 
    Olson, "Infant Mortality in Three Cultural Settings in Montreal, 1880." <i> Infant and Child Mortality in the Past,</i> 1997; and: 
    Francois Pelletier, Jacques Legare, and Robert Bourbeau, "Mortality in Quebec during the Nineteenth Century: From the State to the 
    Cities," <i>Population Studies,</i>) 50, 1, 1997).</p>
    <h4 style="text-align:center;">Method</h4>
    <p>In this project I will focus on two of arguably the most problematic infectious diseases to plague Canadian cities during the 
    19th century: cholera and smallpox. In order to (loosely) track the rise and fall of the severity of the epidemics caused by these 
    diseases, I have assembled datasets from the online archive of the <a href="http://search.canadiana.ca/" target="_blank">Canadiana Discovery Portal.</a>
    </p>
    <p>To build these datasets I have used an API to extract all documents available in the archive that contain hits on the keywords "cholera" and "smallpox." 
    By considering the dates and cities that the materials collected were published in, I was able to create .csv files from which to 
    create various visualizations which I can then use to analyze this data.</p>
    <h5 style="text-align:center;">Taking a Broad Look at Infectious Disease Across Canada During the 19th Century</h5>
    <p>The first interesting way in which I found to visually analyze the data I collected was to consider the frequency with which 
    documents published containing my keywords appear in the digital archive according to date. I have seperated the data into two sets
    , one for cholera, and one for smallpox. Using bar graphs created with Excel, these were the results:</p>
    <center><img src="Cholerabydate2.png";></center>
    <p>In the above graph concerning cholera, we see a peak in the amount of documents published that mention cholera in 1866. 
    This result is interesting when considering the sheer number of secondary material published concerning the cholera epidemics 
    in Upper and Lower Canada between <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/history/EPISCONTENTSE1EP7CH1PA5LE.html" target="_blank">1832</a> and 1866 (see: C. M. Godfrey, "The Cholera Epidemics in Upper Canada 1832-1866, 1968). I found this to be particularly interesting 
    considering the fact that my dataset is so limited in its scope, and yet, seems to produce rather accurate results.</p>
    <center><img src="SmallpoxDates.png";></center>
    <p>In this bar graph we see the reults for smallpox, with the peek years of the epidemic occurring in 1875 and 1876. What is interesting 
    about this result is that this is at a time when there is a serious debate happening in Montreal concerning the idea of compulsory vaccination. 
    What is even more interesting about this is the fact that the controversy surrounding compulsory vaccination during the ten years between 
    1875 and 1885 in Montreal actually culminated in a riot that was reported on as far away as <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9502E2DE1E39E533A2575AC2A96F9C94649FD7CF" target="_blank">New York</a>.</p>
    <p>The next step in analyzing this data in a very broad, national context, is to look at the number of documents published containing my 
    keywords according to city. To do this I have used .csv files to create bar graphs like the ones above, as well as using one of the 
    visualization tools available through <a href="http://raw.densitydesign.org/" target="_blank">RAW</a> called an "Aluvial" vector graph.</p>
    <center><img src="AluvialCholera2.png";></center>
    <p>Here we see that Montreal suffers terribly compared to all other Canadian cities according to the number of publications in the archive. What is also interesting here is that we can 
    see the same major spike in 1866 that we saw in the bar graph above. This vector graph also reflects how
     the spread of cholera to smaller cities like Ottawa happens much later within the timeframe in question. This graph also indicates what one would expect, 
     which is the fact that major port cities like Montreal, Toronto, and Quebec, with large urban populations, are hit the hardest.</p>
     <center><img src="Aluvial3.png";></center>
     <p>In the above graph concerning smallpox, we can see that, according to the material drawn from the archive, it differs significantly from 
     cholera in that it is far more widespread. We can also see that the smaller city of Ottawa has a larger number of publications in the archive 
     concerning the disease than the larger port city of Quebec. While this result is both interesting and unexpected, it must be kept 
     in mind that this could simply be due to the limits of the collection of the digital archive, and is not necessarily representative of actual fact.</p>
     <h6 style="text-align:center;">Taking a Closer Look at Infectious Disease in Canada's Major Urban Cities of the Nineteenth Century: Montreal and Toronto</h6>
     <p>While the above Aluvial graphs give some indication as to the spread of infectious disease per city over time, reading the data in this 
     way from these graphs can be difficult, as the dates are arranged in a rather random order (even though the spreadsheets that these graphs 
     are drawing data from have been organized in ascending order by date). In order to take a closer look at change over time, I have made .csv 
     files contaning data for both Toronto and Montreal from which to construct some frequemcy charts that give a much clearer visualization.</p>
