    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Purpose and Scope of this Project</h2>
    <p>As a student of history at Carleton University, my area of interest is in Canadian urban and social history. During my studies 
    I have bacome particularly interested in 19th century Canada and the effects of industrialization and urbanization. While I have 
    had great success in my studies thus far, these successes have been within the traditional methods of the discipline; research and 
    writing. As such, this is my very first attempt at a digital history project, and is intended only to be an exploration of the ways in which 
    the methods and tools used by digital historians could be applied to the subject matter of a more traditional history project.</p>
    <p>Being that this is my first attempt at creating such a project, I feel that it is very important to state from the outset that 
    the scope of this project is very limited and, as stated above, experimental. The dataset I am working with is very limited in that 
    it has been collected from only one source, the <a href="http://search.canadiana.ca/" target="_blank">Canadiana Discovery Portal.</a></p>
