    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Purpose and Scope of this Project</h2>
    <p>As a student of history at Carleton University, my area of interest is in Canadian urban and social history. During my studies 
    I have bacome particularly interested in 19th century Canada and the effects of industrialization and urbanization. While I have 
    had great success in my studies thus far, these successes have been within the traditional methods of the discipline; research and 
    essay writing. As such, this is my very first attempt at a digital history project, and is intended only to be an exploration of the ways in which 
    the methods and tools used by digital historians could be applied to the subject matter of a more traditional history project. In 
    other words, my purpose is to explore the ways in which these methods could supplement, or add an extra layer to, traditional 
    projects I have done in the past dealing with this subject matter. The benefit here is that the data collected and the visualizations created 
    in this project would be extremely time consuming, if not impossible, in the traditional method; and, not to mention, terribly 
    impractical.</p>
    <p>Being that this is my first attempt at creating such a project, I feel that it is very important to state from the outset that 
    the scope of this project is very limited and, as stated above, experimental. The datasets I am working with are very limited in that 
    they have been collected from only one source, the <a href="http://search.canadiana.ca/" target="_blank">Canadiana Discovery Portal.</a></p>
